# Recommendations
- If the dip in february is due to weather conditions at the beginnning of the year, then stock levels can be controlled to avoid holding excess inventory.
- An increased sales and profits can be recorded if more female appealing products and adverts are made.
- Encouraging customers to reveal gender can help with decisions on adverts and tailor made products appealing to specific gender.
